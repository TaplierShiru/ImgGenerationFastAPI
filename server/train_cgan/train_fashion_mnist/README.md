# Train CGAN on ***fashion-mnist*** dataset
## Dataset
You can download it from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist).

I recommend download it from Kaggle and check my notebook how I load dataset.

## How train
I think that fashion-mnist dataset - is very easy dataset for almost every model/task.

So I trained model using [CGAN model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784) without any super-dupa-changes on 
Kaggle platform, you can check code/run it on this platform.

## How create ONNX
After training, you can check code below **Create ONNX Model** header in notebook, where will be created ONNX model,
and it can be downloaded via files in kaggle.
